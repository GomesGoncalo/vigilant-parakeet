# node crate â€” architecture

Purpose: binary for running one node. Exposes subcommands and delegates to `obu_lib` or `rsu_lib`.

  NodeBinary["node (binary)"] -->|subcommand| ObuLib["obu_lib::Obu"]
  NodeBinary -->|subcommand| RsuLib["rsu_lib::Rsu"]
  ObuLib --> Common["common::Tun/Device"]
  RsuLib --> Common
```

Notes:
- This crate provides a CLI with `node obu` and `node rsu` subcommands and initializes the respective node via `*_lib::create`.
- Useful for debugging per-node behavior in isolation.
